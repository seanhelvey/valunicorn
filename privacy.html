<h2>Introduction</h2>
We are committed to respecting your online privacy, and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us. While we cannot guarantee privacy perfection, we will address any issue to the best of our abilities as soon as possible.
Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, personal profile, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether at work or at home.

We will not share, sell, or otherwise disclose your information to any other companies, advertisers, or the public. Signing up with Valunicorn means signing up for Valunicorn only. Our newsletter utilizes MailChimp to store and email the listserv of registered users, so it is recommended you read their privacy policy.
Valunicorn strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, Valunicorn intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require an "adequate" level of protection for your Personal Information. In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained. Finally, we may disclose your Personal Information or any information you submitted via the Site and its services (including via your Seeking Alpha email account) if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, ii) enforce our Terms of Service including investigations of potential violations thereof, iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or security issues, or iv) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Valunicorn, its users, yourself or the public.
