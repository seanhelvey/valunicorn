module List.Nonempty exposing (..)

{-| A list that cannot be empty. The head and tail can be accessed without Maybes. Most other list functions are
available.

# Definition
@docs Nonempty

# Create
@docs fromElement, fromList

# Access
@docs head, tail, toList, get, sample

# Inspect
Nonempty lists support equality with the usual `(==)` operator (provided their contents also support equality).
@docs isSingleton, length, member, all, any

# Convert
@docs cons, (:::), append, pop, reverse, concat

# Swap
@docs replaceHead, replaceTail, dropTail

# Map
@docs map, indexedMap, map2, andMap, concatMap

# Filter
@docs filter

# Fold
To fold or scan from the right, reverse the list first.
@docs foldl, foldl1, scanl, scanl1

# Sort
@docs sort, sortBy, sortWith

# Deduplicate
The nonempty list's elements must support equality (e.g. not functions). Otherwise  you will get a runtime error.
